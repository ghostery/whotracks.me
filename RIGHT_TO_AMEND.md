# Right to Amend
A Guideline for 3rd parties wanting to suggest corrections to their data


whotracks.me has already grown to be the most comprehensive transparency 
and monitoring tool on online tracking that we are aware of. It already 
features longitudinal data of more than 800 million page loads.

We are constantly working on improving the quality of our database, and at this 
scale, it is possible to have minor inaccuracies. Hence, we are always happy to 
amend incorrect entries when pointed out.

This is a guideline for 3rd parties wanting to suggest corrections to their
data. 

1. Please reach out by opening an issue in the repository.
2. Identify yourself, and your role in the organization on behalf of which you are 
   proposing an amendment of the data.
3. Provide urls to the whotracks.me pages that contain inaccuracies (e.g. https://whotracks.me/trackers/name-of-tracker)
4. Clearly list the inaccuracy(y/ies), and for each write a sentence or two providing 
   evidence/justification w.r.t. why the current information is not correct.


We don't like inaccurate information just as much as you do, and 
will do our best to resolve the issue as soon as we can.
